This is a program that will pull the data from the r/BehindTheTables and auto generate items and such.
I know this exists, but I want to auto generate a masive list of the items.
I have it being public so if anyone else wants to use this mostly usless tool then they can.

How to:

Regenerate the list of table URLs
1. Remove the URLData.txt file
2. Run the GrabURLs script
3. Add any other urls and their names that you want to the URLData.txt file
3.5. currently the last 7 or so urls from the redit page I am getting the tables from is not being grabbed (so make sure to grab them)
4. deleat the SiteDataJSON.json file and run the ConvertURLTextToJSON file
